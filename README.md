# Prefix and Suffix Word Search

This project is an educational exercise intended to explore the workings of HashSet and TreeSet collections in Java. It showcases the abilities of these data structures and their application for specific tasks.

## Task Description

The task was to create a mini-application for processing and searching words by prefix or suffix. A crucial requirement was to minimize code duplication while providing two separate implementations of this functionality for two different types of collections - HashSet and TreeSet.

The task included the following subtasks:

1. Designing a system capable of accepting an array of words and adding it to the respective collection.
2. Implementing a function to search for words beginning with a specified prefix. A vital requirement was to ensure high-speed operation.
3. Implementing a function to search for words ending with a given suffix. This operation also had to be performed quickly.
4. Developing a function to check whether a specified word is contained in the collection.

It's important to note that only methods from the HashSet and TreeSet classes were used, demonstrating their unique features and differences. The result is a system capable of efficiently processing and searching for words by prefix or suffix in two different types of collections.
